1：Much the same way as regular properties, the properties declared in the primary constructor can be mutable (var) or read-only (val).

2：Note that parameters of the primary constructor can be used in the initializer blocks. They can also be used in property initializers declared in the class body
class Customer(name: String) {
    val customerKey = name.toUpperCase()
}

3：In fact, for declaring properties and initializing them from the primary constructor, Kotlin has a concise syntax:
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, var age: Int) {
    // ...
}

4：it will have a generated primary constructor with no argument  ---> just like java ! if dont want this , so look:
class DontCreateMe private constructor () {
}

5:generate an additional parameterless constructor  生成一个额外的无参数的构造函数
